# Coast Guard Award Writing Tool - Final Report

## Project Overview
This project has developed a comprehensive design for a Python-based military award writing tool specifically for the Coast Guard. The tool addresses the problem of subjectivity in awards by implementing an AI-based chat interface that gathers quantitative and action-impact-results data, then recommends appropriate awards based on objective criteria from the Coast Guard Military Medals and Awards Manual (COMDTINST M1650.25E) and the Coast Guard Civilian Awards Manual (COMDTINST M12451.1C).

## Key Components Developed

### 1. Award Criteria Analysis
We conducted a thorough analysis of the Coast Guard awards manuals to extract objective criteria for different award levels. This analysis ensures that award recommendations are based on documented standards rather than rank or position.

### 2. Chat Interface Design
A detailed design for a GUI-based chat interface has been created. The interface features:
- A conversational AI approach to data gathering
- Text wrapping for input fields as requested
- Structured data collection focusing on quantitative metrics and action-impact-results
- Integration with OpenAI API for natural language processing

### 3. Award Recommendation Algorithm
A comprehensive algorithm design has been developed that:
- Scores achievements based on objective criteria from the manuals
- Applies appropriate thresholds for different award levels
- Ensures rank neutrality in the recommendation process
- Provides consistent results for similar achievements

### 4. Explanation Module
The explanation module design provides:
- Clear justifications for award recommendations
- Direct references to manual criteria
- Transparency in the decision-making process
- Evidence-based reasoning that focuses on achievements rather than rank

### 5. Validation Framework
A robust validation framework has been designed to:
- Test rank neutrality across different scenarios
- Ensure consistency in recommendations
- Verify alignment with manual criteria
- Provide comprehensive documentation of validation results

### 6. Implementation Plan
A detailed implementation plan has been created, including:
- Project structure and organization
- Required libraries and dependencies
- Code examples for key components
- Testing and validation procedures

## Deliverables

1. **Project Documentation**:
   - Award criteria notes from manual analysis
   - Chat interface design specifications
   - Award algorithm design documentation
   - Explanation module design
   - Validation framework and sample scenarios
   - Implementation plan

2. **Next Steps for Implementation**:
   - Set up Python development environment
   - Implement GUI components using PyQt or similar framework
   - Integrate OpenAI API using provided key
   - Develop award recommendation algorithm based on design
   - Create explanation module following specifications
   - Implement validation testing framework
   - Validate against sample scenarios

## Conclusion

The Coast Guard Award Writing Tool design addresses the core problem of subjectivity in military awards by creating a system that:

1. Focuses on gathering objective, quantitative data about service members' accomplishments
2. Applies consistent criteria derived directly from official Coast Guard manuals
3. Makes recommendations based on achievements rather than rank
4. Provides clear explanations that reference specific manual criteria
5. Can be validated for rank neutrality and consistency

When implemented, this tool will help ensure that Coast Guard personnel receive appropriate recognition based on their actual accomplishments rather than their rank, leading to a more fair and objective awards process.

The comprehensive design documentation provides all necessary information to proceed with implementation, and the sample validation scenarios will ensure the final product meets the objective of rank-neutral award recommendations.
