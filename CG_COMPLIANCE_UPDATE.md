- Follows official CG document structure

### 3. OpenAI Client Updates (`openai_client.py`)
Modified the award drafting to:

### 4. UI/UX Updates
- **Removed score displays** from all user-facing interfaces

## Compliance Features

### Standard Opening Phrases
Each award type now uses its required opening phrase:
- **DSM**: "For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government..."
- **Legion of Merit**: "For exceptionally meritorious conduct..."
- **MSM**: "For outstanding meritorious service..."
- **Commendation Medal**: "For superior performance of duty..."
- **Achievement Medal**: "For professional achievement..."
- **Letter of Commendation**: "For outstanding performance of duty..."

### Standard Closing Phrases
All citations end with appropriate closing statements about dedication, devotion to duty, and keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.

### Line Limits Enforced
- **MSM and below**: Maximum 12 lines (14 with devices)
- **Above MSM**: Maximum 16 lines (18 with valor device)

### Formatting Requirements
- **Orientation**: Landscape for citations
- **Font**: Times New Roman 11pt bold
- **Margins**: 1" sides, 1" top, 2" bottom (for seal)
- **No acronyms**: Spelled out all abbreviations
- **No scoring**: Removed all numerical scores from output

## Testing Results
The compliance test demonstrates:
- ✓ Proper opening phrases
