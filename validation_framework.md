# Objective Award Criteria Validation Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the framework for validating that the Coast Guard Award Writing Tool's recommendations are based on objective criteria rather than rank. It establishes the testing methodology and validation process to ensure the tool produces fair, consistent, and manual-aligned award recommendations.

## Validation Principles
1. **Rank Neutrality**: Identical accomplishments should receive the same award recommendation regardless of rank
2. **Consistency**: Similar achievements should receive similar recommendations
3. **Manual Alignment**: All recommendations must be traceable to specific criteria in the Coast Guard manuals
4. **Evidence Sensitivity**: Recommendations should respond appropriately to changes in evidence strength

## Testing Methodology

### Rank Neutrality Testing
- Create identical achievement profiles with different ranks
- Compare award recommendations across ranks
- Verify explanation text focuses on achievements, not position
- Test with various achievement levels and award types

### Consistency Testing
- Develop multiple similar achievement scenarios with minor variations
- Verify recommendations remain consistent when variations are non-material
- Confirm appropriate changes in recommendations when significant variations exist

### Manual Alignment Verification
- Cross-reference all recommendations with specific manual sections
- Verify thresholds and criteria are accurately implemented
- Ensure explanations cite relevant manual criteria

### Edge Case Testing
- Test borderline cases between award levels
- Verify handling of unusual or exceptional circumstances
- Test with minimal information and with extensive information

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario Set 1: Identical Achievements, Different Ranks
- Create identical achievement profiles for:
  - E-4 (Petty Officer Third Class)
  - E-7 (Chief Petty Officer)
  - O-2 (Lieutenant Junior Grade)
  - O-5 (Commander)
- Verify identical recommendations across all ranks

### Scenario Set 2: Progressive Achievement Levels
- Create scenarios with progressively increasing impact and scope
- Verify appropriate progression through award levels
- Test sensitivity to quantitative changes

### Scenario Set 3: Special Categories
- Test heroism scenarios
- Test technical innovation scenarios
- Test leadership and management scenarios
- Test operational excellence scenarios

## Validation Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Rank Neutrality Score**: Percentage of identical recommendations for same achievements across ranks
- **Manual Alignment Score**: Percentage of recommendations with direct manual criteria support
- **Explanation Quality**: Clarity, specificity, and evidence-basis of explanations

### Secondary Metrics
- **Consistency Index**: Similarity of recommendations for similar achievements
- **Threshold Accuracy**: Correct application of minimum criteria for each award level
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on explanation clarity and recommendation appropriateness

## Validation Process

### 1. Scenario Development
- Create comprehensive test scenario library
- Include various achievement types, scopes, and impacts
- Develop control scenarios with known expected outcomes

### 2. Blind Testing
- Run scenarios through the recommendation algorithm
- Compare outputs across rank variations
- Document all recommendations and explanations

### 3. Manual Review
- Expert review of recommendations against manual criteria
- Identification of any rank-based patterns or biases
- Assessment of explanation quality and accuracy

### 4. Refinement Cycle
- Adjust algorithm based on validation findings
- Re-test with original and new scenarios
- Document improvements and remaining issues

## Documentation Requirements

### Validation Report
- Summary of validation methodology
- Results of all test scenarios
- Analysis of rank neutrality performance
- Recommendations for improvements

### Evidence Repository
- Archive of all test scenarios
- Record of all recommendations and explanations
- Cross-reference to manual criteria
- Before/after comparisons for refinements

## Success Criteria
The validation will be considered successful when:
1. Rank Neutrality Score exceeds 95%
2. Manual Alignment Score exceeds 98%
3. No systematic bias patterns are identified
4. Explanations consistently reference specific manual criteria
5. Edge cases are handled appropriately with clear explanations

## Next Steps
1. Develop comprehensive test scenario library
2. Implement validation testing framework
3. Conduct initial validation testing
4. Document results and refine algorithm as needed
5. Perform final validation and prepare report
