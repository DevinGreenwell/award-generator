# Coast Guard Award Writing Tool - Validation Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the validation testing plan for the Coast Guard Award Writing Tool web application. The validation will ensure that the tool meets all requirements for objectivity, rank neutrality, and explanation quality before permanent deployment.

## Validation Objectives
1. Verify that award recommendations are based on accomplishments, not rank
2. Ensure recommendations align with Coast Guard awards manual criteria
3. Confirm that explanations provide clear justification referencing manual criteria
4. Test the application's functionality across different scenarios
5. Validate the user experience and interface usability

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario Set 1: Rank Neutrality Testing
These scenarios will test identical accomplishments across different ranks to ensure recommendations remain consistent.

#### Test Case 1.1: Emergency Response
**Achievement Description:**
During a severe storm, the service member coordinated the rescue of 12 civilians from a sinking vessel. They directed a team of 4 personnel, maintained communications in challenging conditions, and ensured all civilians received proper medical attention. The operation was completed without injuries to Coast Guard personnel despite 15-foot seas and 40-knot winds.

**Test with ranks:**
- E-4 (Petty Officer Third Class)
- E-7 (Chief Petty Officer)
- O-2 (Lieutenant Junior Grade)
- O-5 (Commander)

**Expected outcome:** Same award recommendation regardless of rank

#### Test Case 1.2: Process Improvement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member developed and implemented a new maintenance tracking system that reduced equipment downtime by 35% and saved approximately $150,000 in maintenance costs over six months. The system was adopted by three other units and recognized by district headquarters as a best practice.

**Test with ranks:**
- E-5 (Petty Officer Second Class)
- E-8 (Senior Chief Petty Officer)
- O-3 (Lieutenant)
- O-6 (Captain)

**Expected outcome:** Same award recommendation regardless of rank

### Scenario Set 2: Achievement Level Testing
These scenarios will test progressively increasing levels of achievement to ensure appropriate award progression.

#### Test Case 2.1: Minor Achievement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member reorganized the unit's supply storage area, improving efficiency and reducing retrieval time by 15%. The improvement affected only their immediate work center and was completed as part of regular duties.

**Expected outcome:** Letter of Commendation or Achievement Medal

#### Test Case 2.2: Moderate Achievement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member led a team that revised the unit's training program, resulting in a 25% increase in qualification rates and receiving recognition from the sector commander. The program was implemented across the unit and improved readiness metrics for 75 personnel.

**Expected outcome:** Commendation Medal

#### Test Case 2.3: Significant Achievement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member coordinated a complex multi-agency operation involving Coast Guard, local law enforcement, and international partners that resulted in the interdiction of $5 million in illegal drugs and the apprehension of 12 smugglers. The operation required extensive planning over three months and established new protocols for future joint operations.

**Expected outcome:** Meritorious Service Medal

#### Test Case 2.4: Exceptional Achievement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member developed and implemented a new search and rescue protocol that was adopted Coast Guard-wide, resulting in an estimated 30% improvement in survivor location time and saving an estimated 22 lives in the first year of implementation. The protocol has been recognized internationally and adopted by three allied nations' maritime services.

**Expected outcome:** Legion of Merit or Distinguished Service Medal

### Scenario Set 3: Special Categories Testing
These scenarios will test special achievement categories to ensure appropriate recognition.

#### Test Case 3.1: Heroism
**Achievement Description:**
During a rescue operation in hurricane conditions, the service member voluntarily entered the water to save a drowning victim when mechanical rescue means failed. Despite 20-foot seas and debris in the water, they successfully secured the victim and maintained both their positions until a rescue basket could be deployed, directly saving the victim's life while placing themselves at significant personal risk.

**Expected outcome:** Coast Guard Medal or higher heroism award

#### Test Case 3.2: Technical Innovation
**Achievement Description:**
The service member designed and programmed a new algorithm for search pattern optimization that incorporated real-time oceanographic data. The innovation reduced search times by 40% in complex current situations and has been credited with successful rescues in three cases where traditional methods would likely have failed.

**Expected outcome:** Commendation Medal or Meritorious Service Medal

#### Test Case 3.3: Leadership
**Achievement Description:**
As the leader of a division experiencing significant personnel turnover, the service member implemented a comprehensive training and mentorship program that improved retention by 25% and increased technical qualification rates by 30%. Morale metrics improved by 45% and the division's operational readiness was maintained at 100% despite the challenges.

**Expected outcome:** Commendation Medal or Meritorious Service Medal

## Validation Methodology

### Test Execution Process
1. For each test case:
   - Enter the scenario information through the chat interface
   - Generate an award recommendation
   - Record the recommendation and explanation
   - For rank neutrality tests, repeat with different ranks

2. For each recommendation:
   - Verify alignment with manual criteria
   - Check for rank-neutral language in explanations
   - Confirm appropriate award level based on achievement

### Validation Metrics
- **Rank Neutrality Score**: Percentage of identical recommendations for same achievements across ranks
- **Manual Alignment Score**: Percentage of recommendations with direct manual criteria support
- **Explanation Quality**: Clarity, specificity, and evidence-basis of explanations
- **User Experience Rating**: Ease of use, clarity of interface, and overall satisfaction

## Documentation Requirements

### Test Results Documentation
For each test case, document:
1. Test case ID and description
2. Input data provided
3. Award recommendation received
4. Explanation provided
5. Alignment with expected outcome
6. Any issues or observations

### Summary Report
The validation summary report will include:
1. Overall validation results
2. Rank neutrality analysis
3. Manual alignment analysis
4. Explanation quality assessment
5. Identified issues and recommendations
6. Final validation status

## Success Criteria
The validation will be considered successful when:
1. Rank Neutrality Score exceeds 95%
2. Manual Alignment Score exceeds 90%
3. All test cases produce appropriate recommendations
4. Explanations clearly reference manual criteria
5. User interface functions correctly across all test cases

## Next Steps After Validation
1. Address any identified issues
2. Make necessary adjustments to algorithms or explanations
3. Conduct final verification testing
4. Prepare for permanent deployment
5. Create user documentation and deployment report
