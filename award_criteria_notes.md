# Coast Guard Award Criteria Notes

## Overview
This document contains key findings from the Coast Guard Military Medals and Awards Manual (COMDTINST M1650.25E) and the Coast Guard Civilian Awards Manual (COMDTINST M12451.1C) to inform the design of our award writing tool.

## Key Observations
1. The Coast Guard has specific award criteria that should be objectively applied regardless of rank
2. Both military and civilian award systems exist with their own criteria
3. Quantitative data and action-impact-results are critical for proper award evaluation
4. The tool should gather sufficient information to match accomplishments against the standards in the manuals

## Data Collection Requirements
Based on the manuals, our chat interface should gather:

1. **Basic Information**
   - Nominee's name
   - Nominee's rank/grade
   - Nominee's unit/position
   - Time period covered by the award

2. **Quantitative Metrics**
   - Numerical achievements (e.g., number of lives saved, percentage improvements)
   - Scope of impact (individual, unit, Coast Guard-wide, interagency)
   - Duration of achievement or service

3. **Action-Impact-Results Data**
   - Specific actions taken by the nominee
   - Direct impact of those actions
   - Measurable results and outcomes
   - Comparison to standard performance expectations

4. **Supporting Context**
   - Unusual circumstances or challenges
   - Initiative demonstrated
   - Leadership qualities exhibited
   - Technical skills utilized

## Award Types
The tool should be able to recommend appropriate award levels based on the gathered data, including:

1. Military Personal Awards
   - Medal of Honor
   - Distinguished Service Medal
   - Silver Star
   - Legion of Merit
   - Distinguished Flying Cross
   - Coast Guard Medal
   - Gold Lifesaving Medal
   - Silver Lifesaving Medal
   - Distinguished Service Medal
   - Meritorious Service Medal
   - Air Medal
   - Coast Guard Commendation Medal
   - Coast Guard Achievement Medal
   - Commandant's Letter of Commendation

2. Civilian Awards
   - Distinguished Civilian Service Award
   - Meritorious Civilian Service Award
   - Civilian Achievement Medal
   - Commandant's Superior Achievement Award
   - Commandant's Letter of Commendation

## Next Steps
Further detailed review of specific award criteria is needed to develop the objective recommendation algorithm. The chat interface should be designed to systematically gather all required information while maintaining a conversational flow.
