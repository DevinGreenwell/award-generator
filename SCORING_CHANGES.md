# Coast Guard Award Generator - Scoring System Updates

## Overview
The award scoring system has been made significantly more stringent to ensure proper standardization and prevent over-generous award recommendations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Award Thresholds (Raised Across the Board)
- **Medal of Honor**: 92% → 96%
- **Distinguished Service Medal**: 84% → 90%
- **Legion of Merit**: 76% → 82%
- **Meritorious Service Medal**: 70% → 74%
- **Coast Guard Commendation Medal**: 60% → 65%
- **Coast Guard Achievement Medal**: 50% → 56%
- **Coast Guard Letter of Commendation**: 40% → 45%

### 2. Scoring Weights (Adjusted for Stricter Evaluation)
```
- Impact: 5 → 6 (increased importance)
- Scope: 5 → 6 (increased importance)
- Leadership: 5 → 6 (increased importance)
- Quantifiable Results: 4 → 5 (increased importance)
- Innovation: 4 → 3 (decreased - innovation alone isn't enough)
- Collaboration: 4 → 3 (decreased - good but not primary)
- Training Provided: 3 → 2 (decreased - expected duty)
```

### 3. Leadership Scoring Changes
- **Personnel Requirements Increased**:
  - 150+ people for max score (was 100+)
  - 75+ people for high score (was 50+)
  - 40+ people for medium score (was 25+)
  - Less than 10 people = no bonus
- **Leadership Details Requirements**:
  - Need 5+ leadership examples for top score (was 4+)
  - Scoring reduced at all levels
- **Training Provided**:
  - Now requires 3+ training activities for bonus (was 2+)

### 4. Impact Scoring Changes
- **Focus on Measurable Impacts**:
  - Prioritizes impacts with numbers, percentages, or quantifiable outcomes
  - Non-measurable impacts receive minimal credit (max 0.5 points)
- **Keyword Requirements Increased**:
  - High-impact keywords: need 5+ for bonus (was 4+)
  - Medium-impact keywords: need 5+ for bonus (was 3+)
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - Requires 6+ metrics for top score (was 5+)
  - Less than 2 metrics = no bonus

### 5. Scope Scoring Changes
- **Higher Point Requirements**:
  - National/International: 30+ points needed (was 25+)
  - Area/District: 25+ points needed (was 20+)
  - Sector/Group: 12+ points needed (was 9+)
  - Unit level: 8+ points needed (was 6+)
  - Individual contributions receive minimal recognition

### 6. Quantifiable Results Changes
- **Quality Over Quantity**:
  - Prioritizes "high-value" metrics (millions, thousands, percentages, cost savings)
  - Basic metrics receive reduced credit
- **Higher Requirements**:
  - Need 5+ high-value metrics for top score
  - Basic metrics capped at 1.0 bonus
  - Additional metrics need 3+ to get any bonus

### 7. Innovation Scoring Changes
- **Quality Analysis**:
  - Checks for significant innovation keywords (first, new, revolutionary, pioneered)
  - Basic innovations receive minimal credit
- **Reduced Weights**:
  - Keyword bonus reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 per match
  - Overall scoring reduced across all levels

### 8. Above & Beyond Scoring Changes
- **Concrete Evidence Required**:
  - Primary scoring based on specific above_beyond_indicators from data
  - Baseline adjectives reduced from 1.5 to 0.5 automatic score
- **Reduced Multipliers**:
  - Tier 1 (heroic): 1.5x (was 2.0x)
  - Tier 2 (exceptional): 1.0x (was 1.5x)
  - Tier 3 (above standard): 0.5x (was 1.0x)
  - Tier 4 (professional): 0.25x (was 0.5x)
- **Time Sacrifice**:
  - Bonus reduced from 0.3 to 0.2 per indicator
  - Maximum cap reduced from 1.5 to 0.75
- **Exceedance Requirements**:
  - 75%+ exceedance for full bonus (was 50%+)
  - 50%+ for medium bonus (was 25%+)
  - 25%+ for minimal bonus (was 10%+)

### 9. Minimum Requirements Added
All awards now require minimum scores in key areas:
- **Quantifiable Results** added as requirement for most awards
- **Leadership** requirements increased for all awards
- **Impact** and **Scope** thresholds raised

## Expected Impact
These changes will result in:
1. More accurate award recommendations aligned with actual achievement levels
2. Greater emphasis on measurable, quantifiable accomplishments
3. Higher standards for leadership and organizational impact
4. Reduced likelihood of recommending awards above the appropriate level
5. Better standardization across all award recommendations

## Testing Recommendations
Test the new scoring with various scenarios:
1. Basic individual achievement → Should recommend Letter of Commendation or Achievement Medal
2. Unit-level leadership with measurable impacts → Should recommend Commendation Medal
3. Sector/District leadership with significant quantifiable results → Should recommend Meritorious Service Medal
4. Only exceptional, coast guard-wide impact with strong leadership → Should recommend Legion of Merit or higher
