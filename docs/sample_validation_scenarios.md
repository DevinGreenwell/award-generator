# Sample Validation Scenarios

## Overview
This document provides sample validation scenarios to test the Coast Guard Award Writing Tool's ability to make objective, rank-neutral award recommendations. These scenarios will be used to validate that the tool properly applies criteria from the Coast Guard manuals rather than using rank as the primary driver for award level.

## Scenario Set 1: Identical Achievements, Different Ranks

### Scenario 1A: Emergency Response
**Achievement Description:**
During a severe storm, the service member coordinated the rescue of 12 civilians from a sinking vessel. They directed a team of 4 personnel, maintained communications in challenging conditions, and ensured all civilians received proper medical attention. The operation was completed without injuries to Coast Guard personnel despite 15-foot seas and 40-knot winds.

**Test with ranks:**
- E-4 (Petty Officer Third Class)
- E-7 (Chief Petty Officer)
- O-2 (Lieutenant Junior Grade)
- O-5 (Commander)

**Expected outcome:** Same award recommendation regardless of rank

### Scenario 1B: Process Improvement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member developed and implemented a new maintenance tracking system that reduced equipment downtime by 35% and saved approximately $150,000 in maintenance costs over six months. The system was adopted by three other units and recognized by district headquarters as a best practice.

**Test with ranks:**
- E-5 (Petty Officer Second Class)
- E-8 (Senior Chief Petty Officer)
- O-3 (Lieutenant)
- O-6 (Captain)

**Expected outcome:** Same award recommendation regardless of rank

## Scenario Set 2: Progressive Achievement Levels

### Scenario 2A: Minor Achievement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member reorganized the unit's supply storage area, improving efficiency and reducing retrieval time by 15%. The improvement affected only their immediate work center and was completed as part of regular duties.

**Expected outcome:** Letter of Commendation or Achievement Medal

### Scenario 2B: Moderate Achievement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member led a team that revised the unit's training program, resulting in a 25% increase in qualification rates and receiving recognition from the sector commander. The program was implemented across the unit and improved readiness metrics for 75 personnel.

**Expected outcome:** Commendation Medal

### Scenario 2C: Significant Achievement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member coordinated a complex multi-agency operation involving Coast Guard, local law enforcement, and international partners that resulted in the interdiction of $5 million in illegal drugs and the apprehension of 12 smugglers. The operation required extensive planning over three months and established new protocols for future joint operations.

**Expected outcome:** Meritorious Service Medal

### Scenario 2D: Exceptional Achievement
**Achievement Description:**
The service member developed and implemented a new search and rescue protocol that was adopted Coast Guard-wide, resulting in an estimated 30% improvement in survivor location time and saving an estimated 22 lives in the first year of implementation. The protocol has been recognized internationally and adopted by three allied nations' maritime services.

**Expected outcome:** Legion of Merit or Distinguished Service Medal

## Scenario Set 3: Special Categories

### Scenario 3A: Heroism
**Achievement Description:**
During a rescue operation in hurricane conditions, the service member voluntarily entered the water to save a drowning victim when mechanical rescue means failed. Despite 20-foot seas and debris in the water, they successfully secured the victim and maintained both their positions until a rescue basket could be deployed, directly saving the victim's life while placing themselves at significant personal risk.

**Expected outcome:** Coast Guard Medal or higher heroism award

### Scenario 3B: Technical Innovation
**Achievement Description:**
The service member designed and programmed a new algorithm for search pattern optimization that incorporated real-time oceanographic data. The innovation reduced search times by 40% in complex current situations and has been credited with successful rescues in three cases where traditional methods would likely have failed.

**Expected outcome:** Commendation Medal or Meritorious Service Medal

### Scenario 3C: Leadership
**Achievement Description:**
As the leader of a division experiencing significant personnel turnover, the service member implemented a comprehensive training and mentorship program that improved retention by 25% and increased technical qualification rates by 30%. Morale metrics improved by 45% and the division's operational readiness was maintained at 100% despite the challenges.

**Expected outcome:** Commendation Medal or Meritorious Service Medal

## Validation Process
For each scenario:
1. Input the achievement description into the tool
2. For Scenario Set 1, change only the rank while keeping all other details identical
3. Record the award recommendation and explanation
4. Analyze results for consistency and alignment with manual criteria
5. Document any discrepancies or biases

## Success Criteria
- Scenario Set 1: Identical recommendations across all ranks
- Scenario Set 2: Progressively higher award levels as achievement impact increases
- Scenario Set 3: Appropriate recognition of special circumstances
- All scenarios: Explanations that reference specific manual criteria rather than rank
